Because we don't know when will the magnitude 10 occur.</h5><p>The Ring of Fire is an area in the basin of the Pacific Ocean where a 90% of the world's earthqukaes and large number of volcanic eruptions occur.<p>In a 40,000 km (25,000 mi) horseshoe shape, it is associated with a nearly continuous series of oceanic trenches, volcanic arcs, and volcanic belts. It has 452 volcanoes and is home to over 75% of the world's active and dormant volcanoes.<br><br> The map shows the earthquakes occurred within 500 km of major cities around the Pacific Ocean from Dec-05-2014 to Feb-14-2016. The raw data is obtained from<a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/"> USGS </a> and could be overlayed on the map. Some oceanic trenches are marked as well.</p></div>
